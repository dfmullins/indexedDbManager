# indexedDbManager
IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs.  The indexedDB Manager simplifies managing and maintaining indexedDB datastores in one JavaScript file.  This utility includes functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting indexedDB datastore records.  It also reduces complexity in initializing indexedDB datastores and helps with version control.  Additionally, this utility is written in JavaScript, with no reliances on any libraries or third-party technologies, making it easy to update and customize for your specific needs.
